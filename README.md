# Final Project - Penguins dataset:
#### Contains information on 344 penguins of three different species (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) from three different islands (Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen) in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica from 2007 to 2009.
#### Purpose: A marine biologist or a conservationist would be interested in the study of penguins. It would give them insights about the physical characteristics of different penguin species, which could aid in the conservation efforts of these animals.


# Questions:

### 1. How many of each species are on each island?

##### Biscoe Island has the most penguins comprising mainly of the Gentoo species. Meanwhile, Torgerson Island has the lowest number of penguins comprising ony of the Adelie species.

##### Adelie populations are roughly equal in size among the islands. Gentoo penguins are found on Biscoe Island, which is also the largest population. Each species has a roughly equal sex ratio on all three islands. Meanwhile, Chinstrap penguins are only found on Dream Island. 


### 2. How does the body mass of penguins vary across the different species?

##### Gentoo penguins tend to be larger and heavier than Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. Adelie and Chinstrap penguins have similar body mass distributions, with Adelie penguins having a slightly larger range of body mass values. Additionally, males have a large body mass than females for each species.

### 3. What is the relationship between flipper length and body mass in penguins?

##### For each species, there is a positive correlation between flipper length and body mass in penguins. As flipper length increases, body mass tends to increase as well. Gentoo penguins have a larger body mass and longer flippers than Chinstrap and Adelie penguins.

### 4. What is the relationship between bill length and bill depth in penguins?

##### Based on the regression lines, penguins with longer bills also tend to have deeper bills. However, There is also a lot of variability in the data. Some penguins with long bills but shallow depths, and vice versa.

### Correlations:

<img width="525" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-08 at 1 00 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124735350/236885053-4f53e268-cb41-4357-b7e8-9d1190e53030.png">

##### The strongest positive correlation is between body mass and flipper length. The higher the body mass the longer the flippers. 
##### The strongest negative correlation is between bill depth and flipper length. The shallower the bill the longer the flippers. 
##### The weakest correlation is between bill depth and bill length, which is shown by the high variability in the scatterplot. 

### 5. What is the overall Penguin population trend at each island over the 3 years of this study (2007, 2008, 2009)?

##### Biscoe island had the highest number of penguins in 2008 and lowest in 2007. Conversely, Dream island had its highest number of penguins in 2007 and lowest in 2008. 
##### Without additional data over time, marine biologists cannot determine a clear trend in penguin count for each island. Discovering trends in population sized will help determine what is impacting penguin populations in order to effectively aid in conservation efforts.
